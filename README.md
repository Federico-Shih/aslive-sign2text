This is a video classification task using the [WLASL](https://dxli94.github.io/WLASL/) dataset for word level sign language classification. Its a dataset where each word is a snippet of a 256x256 video of multiple people doing one word sign language.

## Reproduction
We've attached the PTH files for the models in which we showed the results. We recommend running this notebook using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and uploading the PTHs to Google Drive and save your progress.


Run pip install for extra dependencies but most of the dependencies should come included on Google Colab.
